**About the Author:**

Solo Sailor is one of the developer superheroes who like to hang out at Outlearn and is Outlearn's resident expert on Docker.

The high seas keep on drawing Solo Sailor to new adventures. While social in nature, at sea she sticks to the "one woman - one boat" philosophy. Any vessel that she builds is tight enough to be unsinkable. She keeps up with her second job as a coder using a satellite link and a waterproof laptop.
